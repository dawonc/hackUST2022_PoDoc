# Millistep by PoDoc

## Summary of our Solution
“Millistep” incorporates 3 approaches: Identification, Reminder, and Suggestion to promote the development of healthier habits. In the identification stage, “Millistep” utilizes the users’ health data to rank factors affecting their current sleeping quality and discover patterns that are used to predict their future sleep quality. Based on the prediction, reminders will be sent out to inform their optimal number or duration of factors (such as number of steps, or sleep duration) to maintain a good sleep quality. From this, “Millistep” will suggest a personalized set of challenges to constructively help them establish healthy habits and ultimately improve their lifestyles.
